## Future Vision

- We want to bring Jetpack Runner to Etherlink Mainnet, where all in-game assets become tradable as onchain NFTs, giving players true ownership of game assets.
- We plan on to build fully onchain game mechanism powered by $JRT (Jetpack Runner Token). Players can earn this token in the game and use it to trade in-game assets as well as swap it on a DeX.
